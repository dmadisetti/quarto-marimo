# PDF Output

```{.python.marimo}
check = """
Quarto can handle images and tables in PDF output, but not rich HTML outputs.
Here's an example of what can be acccomplished with the `marimo` exports to pdf.
"""

if missing_packages:
  check = """
Normally you would see plots and tables in this pdf, but the required packages are not installed.
"""

check
```

## Images

We can still do plots!

```python3
# create the plot in the last line of the cell
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2])
```

```{.python.marimo}
plt.plot([1, 2])
plt.gca()
```

## Tables

We can also do tables!

```python3
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3],
    'B': [4, 5, 6]
})
df
```

```{.python.marimo}
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3],
    'B': [4, 5, 6]
})
df
```

## Text / Markdown

```{.python.marimo}
f"""You can also include text or markdown in the PDF output.
Which can be useful for embedding computed values like the fact
that this was rendered by Marimo {mo.__version__} on {datetime.datetime.now()}.
"""
```

```{.python.marimo}
plt_show_explainer = {
    "Using `plt.show()`": """
    You can use `plt.show()` or `figure.show()` to display
    plots in the console area of a cell. Keep in mind that console
    outputs are not shown in the app view.
    """
}
```


```{.python.marimo}
try:
    import matplotlib

    import datetime
    missing_packages = False
