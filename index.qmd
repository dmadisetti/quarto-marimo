This repository provides a framework for integrating
[`Quarto`](https://quarto.org) with [`marimo`](https://marimo.io),
enabling markdown documents to be executed in a `marimo` environment, and
reactive in page.

```{.python.marimo}
#| echo: true
# Woops, I think I inverted the default such that every editor cell is runnable.
# See last cell for bug
mo.md('''
  # Hello from marimo!

  This is a raw, reactive python cell.
  You can edit it, and the output will change on run.
''').callout("info")
```

## What?

First, aquaint yourself with the [`marimo`](https://marimo.io)! One you've
digested the basics, and maybe [even written a few `marimo`
notebooks](https://marimo.app), start to consider the possibilities of exporting
`marimo` cells to be standalone, Web Assembly modules, embeddable anywhere.

That's where Quarto comes in with the `qmd` format.

`qmd` is a markdown format that allows for the extraction and execution of code
cells in a markdown document. It's a great way to maintain readable documents
exportable to a variety of formats, while still being able to execute code.

This page, and the `marimo` tutorials in the sidebar are `qmd` documents, to get
a sense of what's possible,
[look at their source](javascript:document.getElementById("quarto-code-tools-source").click()).

## Getting started

Write a `qmd` document with `{marimo}` cells.

For instance the following cell

````python
```{{marimo}}
print("remember that stdout is not shown")
result = "Only outputs!"
result,
```
````

produces the following output:

```{.python.marimo}
print("remember that stdout is not shown")
result = "Only outputs!"
result,
```

---

We can make it editable:

````python
```{{marimo}}
#| editor: true
editor_result = "Change me" + ("!" * 3)
editor_result,
```
````

```{.python.marimo}
#| echo: true
editor_result = "Change me" + ("!" * 3)
editor_result,
```

but the default is to show the output only.

---

```{.python.marimo}
mo.md(
  f"The value of `editor_result` in the previous cell: **{editor_result}**")
```

---

Hold `ctrl` to manually run a stale cell.

### but how do I run this?

Use the repo and do some reading! This documentation is TODO.

## Background cells shown for illustration

```{.python.marimo}
#| echo: true
# Bug: Cells are not runnable if no output
import marimo as mo
```
